# GeneticAlgorithm

Inspired from The Coding Train's Genetic Algorithm. Hopefully it will be adapted later to solve a different problem.

A True sentence is generated by coming up with sentences with random characters, reproduced over many generations.
For example, if we want to generate: "hello", a possible genetic path might be,

Gen 1.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"jhkhj"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"sadas"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"hedas"

Gen 2.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"heldf"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"daslo"

Gen n.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"hello"


## Prerequisite
0. Come up with the True Sentence. 

## Setup
1. Create N number of sentences using random characters.

## Draw
2. Come up with fitness function and evaluate each sentence using said function.

3. Pick up two sentences for reproduction based on their fitness probabality. The more fit, the more likely to be picked.
  a. Crossover - Create another sentence by combining the two.
  b. Mutation - Randomly change characters of the sentence based on probability.
  c. Add to population.
  
4. Replace the old pool of sentences with the new one. Repeat until maxFitness score is 1.
